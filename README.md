## Expenses App 

My first app created with react native. It's an expenses app where you can keep track of all of your expenses.

## Project Status

This project is working at the moment. Users can write down their expenses and save them into a firebase database. Currently I'm working on a User Authentication system so they can login into their accounts and keep track of all their expenses.
